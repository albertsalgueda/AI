CHALLENGE 3 
--> get the subdirectory correctly
.DS_Store

CHALLENGE 4 
--> low accuracy
333/333 - 1s - loss: 3.5034 - accuracy: 0.0530 - 1s/epoch - 4ms/step

--> tried random stuff and increased accuracy ( sometimes used 100 epochs )
333/333 - 2s - loss: 1.3413 - accuracy: 0.5684 - 2s/epoch - 7ms/step
333/333 - 4s - loss: 0.9927 - accuracy: 0.6835 - 4s/epoch - 11ms/step

--> did some research on Image Processing and reached high accuracy
Epoch 10/10
500/500 [==============================] - 9s 18ms/step - loss: 0.1134 - accuracy: 0.9715
